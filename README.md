# Game search page

 ### when i started to code this was my first solo featch api project done in react

 So I decided to take a look and did some changes, think i will work on this one a lil bit

 What I could to next
 Rawg took away the clips so I might pull some videos from an other sourse to insert videos of the games

 Also change UI and put in filters to filter the data that i fetched in different ways
